Cache AI Orgin Game:

Please add a new mini-game page before the quiz. The game is called "Catch the AI Origin!" and it should follow this concept:
There are 3 baskets, each representing a region:
- USA (e.g. with the US flag)
- Europe (including the UK)
- China

These baskets are connected together at the bottom and move left and right as one group.
Random AI-related items (company or product names) fall slowly from the top. Example items:
- USA: NVIDIA, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, LLaMA, Runway, MidJourney, ElevenLabs
- Europe: Mistral AI, Stable Diffusion
- China: DeepSeek, Manus, Qwen, Kling

The order, timing, and horizontal position of each falling item should be randomized, but spaced out enough to give the user time to react.
The user must move the baskets horizontally (by arrow keys, drag, or touch) to catch the item in the correct regional basket.
If the user catches all correctly, show a success message and enable the Next button to go to the quiz page.
If one item is caught in the wrong basket, stop the game immediately and show a message like:
"Oops! DeepSeek is from China."
→ Offer a "Try Again" button to restart the game.

The visual style should match the existing app:
- Clean and elegant
- Use the same fonts and rounded corner style
- Background can be white/light for reading mode and dark for presentation mode, if possibl

Make sure the game logic only enables progression after a full correct match, and that the entire game appears as a standalone page.
